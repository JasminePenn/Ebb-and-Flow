# **"A Dao of Web Design" Summary**
*by Jasmine Penn* 

<p>As defined by John Allsop in his article “A Dao of Web Design”, Daoism is “a way of living, of being in the world”.  He believes that graphhic designers should use the philosophies of Daoism when coding and creating websites.  The key element of integrating Daoism with coding is approaching it with an open mind.  Allsop pushes respecting the traditional, but remembering new mediums require new ideas and methodology.  He also stresses making website UI as adaptable and accessible as possible.  Making things easier to read by using universal fonts, not relying on colors too much, and creating layouts that can be used in different formats can help make a site more user-friendly.  In his opinion, a great designer always keeps accessibility in mind.  Additionally, Allsop mentions being willing to change and adapt, as a designer cannot possibly plan for every single variable.</p>
