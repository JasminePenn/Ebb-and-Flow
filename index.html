        <p><em>by Jasmine Penn</em> </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>As defined by John Allsop in his article “A Dao of Web Design”, Daoism is “a way of living, of being in the world”.  He believes that designers should use the philosophies of Daoism when coding.  The key element of integrating Daoism with coding is approaching it with an open mind.  Allsop pushes respecting the traditional, but remembering new mediums require new ideas and methods.  He also stresses making website UI as adaptable and accessible as possible.  Making things easier to read by using universal fonts, not relying on colors too much, and creating layouts that can be used in different formats can help make a site more user-friendly.  However, Allsop also stresses being open minded, as a designer cannot possibly plan for every single variable.  </p>
